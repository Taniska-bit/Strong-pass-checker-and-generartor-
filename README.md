# Strong-pass-checker-and-generartor-
strong password checker evaluates the security of a password based on several criteria, such as length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and patterns. A password generator creates random, complex passwords that are difficult to guess, often incorporating these same criteria. Strong password generators help to work securely.
